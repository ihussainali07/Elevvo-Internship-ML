# ðŸ“ˆ Student Score Prediction â€“ ML Regression Project

This project is part of my 30-Day Machine Learning Challenge with Elevvo Internship.  
The goal is to predict students' exam scores based on the number of study hours using linear and polynomial regression.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Project Objective

- Predict exam scores using:
  - âœ… Linear Regression
  - âœ… Polynomial Regression (Bonus)
- Evaluate and compare both models
- Visualize the relationship and model predictions

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Student Scores Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv)
- 25 samples with two columns:
  - `Hours`: Hours studied
  - `Scores`: Exam results

---

## ðŸ§  Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, PolynomialFeatures, model evaluation tools)

## âœ… Results

| Model               | MSE   | RÂ² Score |
|---------------------|--------|----------|
| Linear Regression   | 18.94 | 0.97     |
| Polynomial (deg=2)  | 21.07 | 0.96     |

âœ… The linear model performed slightly better, with a simple and accurate fit.  
The polynomial model added curve flexibility but did not outperform the linear one in this case.
